# Multi-View-Fusion-View-Missing-in-Cardiovascular-Signals
## Project Overview
This project aims to fuse two typical views of the cardiovascular system (ECG and PPG) with the proposed View-Centric Transformer(VCT) and multi-task masked autoencoders(M2AE). The prompt technique is introduced to handle common missing-view issues in real applications.
## Paper Status
Currently, the related paper is accepted by Neural Networks.
## Expectations:
Due to personal reasons, we plan to release the code on this GitHub repository before December.
